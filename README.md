# AstroTalk
## What is AstroTalk
AstroTalk allows you to leave voicemails with your alien friends thousands of lightyears away (as long as your message taking thousands of years to send)

We believe that trying to communicate with the extraterrestrial shouldn't just be a fancypants scientist thing. At [astrotalk.tk], you can send out your own personal audio clips for ET. 

The first audio clip to be sent using astrotalk is [amogus](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-NcrRzH0vA&ab_channel=Rainy). It will reach the M69 star cluster (nice) a little over 28 thousand years from now, so around the year 30000. 

## How does AstroTalk Work
After your request is send and processed through [astrotalk.tk], your audio clip is sent through a high (ish) power, high frequency, and focused radio signal. This signal is alined to your chosen destination using a standard telescope.
